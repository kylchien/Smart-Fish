# Smart-Fish
<body>
Fish trained by genetic-algorithm/artificial neural network are not dumb!<br>

No need to code swimming pattern - fish evolve by themselves.<br>

"Natural selection" - only the fish that swallow the most baits can reproduce offsprings.<br>

Please use .net 4.0 or newer version to compile.
